After completing two years in Computer Science, I have always been enthusiastic about participating and collaborating in different projects and custom solutions. Almost 4 years ago I immersed myself in the Dart/Flutter world and I continue to develop in that field. The hunger for knowledge does not stop, I continue to grow and expand my skills, discovering the incredible power of Rust. With the arrival of the AI ​​to the popular reach I have approached the company of training an AI model as a development tool for Dart/Flutter, to continue developing an extension for VSCode with updated snippets with the best practices, architectures, and integration of the trained AI model. for Dart/Flutter. I'm glad you visited my profile, you can contact me for my services or hiring.",
